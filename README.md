# Training-DL-models-on-DNA-sequence

This is an ongoing attempt to learn training deep learning models to distinguish different types of sequences such as enhancers from promoters. For enhaners, primairly H3K4me1 sequences are being used while for promoters H3K4me3 sequences are used. The test sequences would be of of transcription factors I worked with during my PhD such as aryl hydrocarbon receptor and estrogen receptor alpha.
